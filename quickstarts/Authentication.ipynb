            "text/markdown": "Python provides incredibly flexible ways to sort lists! You have two primary built-in options, plus the ability to customize the sorting logic.\n\nHere are the most common ways, with explanations and examples:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `list.sort()` - Sorts the list **in-place**\n\nThis method modifies the original list directly and doesn't return a new list (it returns `None`). Use this when you don't need to preserve the original order of the list.\n\n**Basic Usage:**\n\n```python\nmy_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nprint(\"Original list:\", my_list)\n\nmy_list.sort() # Sorts in ascending order by default\nprint(\"Sorted in-place (ascending):\", my_list)\n\n# Sorting in descending order\nmy_list.sort(reverse=True)\nprint(\"Sorted in-place (descending):\", my_list)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal list: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nSorted in-place (ascending): [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]\nSorted in-place (descending): [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. `sorted()` - Returns a **new sorted list**\n\nThis built-in function returns a *new* sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged. This is often preferred when you need to keep the original list intact or when sorting an iterable that isn't a list (like a tuple, set, or dictionary keys/values).\n\n**Basic Usage:**\n\n```python\noriginal_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nprint(\"Original list:\", original_list)\n\nnew_sorted_list_asc = sorted(original_list) # Returns a new sorted list (ascending)\nprint(\"New sorted list (ascending):\", new_sorted_list_asc)\nprint(\"Original list after sorted():\", original_list) # Original is unchanged\n\nnew_sorted_list_desc = sorted(original_list, reverse=True) # Returns a new sorted list (descending)\nprint(\"New sorted list (descending):\", new_sorted_list_desc)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal list: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nNew sorted list (ascending): [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]\nOriginal list after sorted(): [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nNew sorted list (descending): [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Custom Sorting with the `key` Argument\n\nBoth `list.sort()` and `sorted()` accept a `key` argument, which is a function that will be called on each element of the list before comparisons are made. This is incredibly powerful for sorting complex data structures or non-standard types.\n\n**a) Sorting Strings (e.g., Case-Insensitive):**\n\n```python\nwords = [\"Banana\", \"apple\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\"]\n\n# Default sort (case-sensitive, 'B' < 'a')\nprint(\"Default string sort:\", sorted(words))\n\n# Case-insensitive sort using str.lower as the key\nprint(\"Case-insensitive sort:\", sorted(words, key=str.lower))\n\n# Sort by length of the word\nprint(\"Sort by length:\", sorted(words, key=len))\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nDefault string sort: ['Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'apple']\nCase-insensitive sort: ['apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date']\nSort by length: ['Date', 'Banana', 'apple', 'Cherry']\n```\n\n**b) Sorting Lists of Tuples/Lists (by a specific element):**\n\n```python\ndata = [(\"Alice\", 30), (\"Bob\", 25), (\"Charlie\", 35), (\"David\", 25)]\n\n# Sort by age (the second element of each tuple)\n# Using a lambda function:\nsorted_by_age = sorted(data, key=lambda item: item[1])\nprint(\"Sorted by age:\", sorted_by_age)\n\n# Sort by age (descending), then by name (ascending) for ties\nsorted_by_age_then_name = sorted(data, key=lambda item: (item[1], item[0]), reverse=True)\nprint(\"Sorted by age (desc) then name (asc for ties):\", sorted_by_age_then_name)\n\n# For multiple criteria, you can pass a tuple of keys:\nsorted_by_name_then_age = sorted(data, key=lambda item: (item[0], item[1]))\nprint(\"Sorted by name then age:\", sorted_by_name_then_age)\n\n# A more efficient alternative for item access: operator.itemgetter\nimport operator\nsorted_by_age_itemgetter = sorted(data, key=operator.itemgetter(1))\nprint(\"Sorted by age (itemgetter):\", sorted_by_age_itemgetter)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nSorted by age: [('Bob', 25), ('David', 25), ('Alice', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]\nSorted by age (desc) then name (asc for ties): [('Charlie', 35), ('Alice', 30), ('David', 25), ('Bob', 25)]\nSorted by name then age: [('Alice', 30), ('Bob', 25), ('Charlie', 35), ('David', 25)]\nSorted by age (itemgetter): [('Bob', 25), ('David', 25), ('Alice', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]\n```\n\n**c) Sorting Custom Objects:**\n\n```python\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def __repr__(self): # This helps with printing the object nicely\n        return f\"Person(name='{self.name}', age={self.age})\"\n\npeople = [\n    Person(\"Alice\", 30),\n    Person(\"Bob\", 25),\n    Person(\"Charlie\", 35),\n    Person(\"David\", 25)\n]\n\n# Sort by age\nsorted_people_by_age = sorted(people, key=lambda p: p.age)\nprint(\"Sorted by age:\", sorted_people_by_age)\n\n# Sort by name\nsorted_people_by_name = sorted(people, key=lambda p: p.name)\nprint(\"Sorted by name:\", sorted_people_by_name)\n\n# Sort by age (descending), then by name (ascending) for ties\nsorted_people_complex = sorted(people, key=lambda p: (p.age, p.name), reverse=True)\nprint(\"Sorted by age (desc) then name (asc for ties):\", sorted_people_complex)\n\n# A more efficient alternative for attribute access: operator.attrgetter\nimport operator\nsorted_people_by_age_attrgetter = sorted(people, key=operator.attrgetter('age'))\nprint(\"Sorted by age (attrgetter):\", sorted_people_by_age_attrgetter)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nSorted by age: [Person(name='Bob', age=25), Person(name='David', age=25), Person(name='Alice', age=30), Person(name='Charlie', age=35)]\nSorted by name: [Person(name='Alice', age=30), Person(name='Bob', age=25), Person(name='Charlie', age=35), Person(name='David', age=25)]\nSorted by age (desc) then name (asc for ties): [Person(name='Charlie', age=35), Person(name='Alice', age=30), Person(name='David', age=25), Person(name='Bob', age=25)]\nSorted by age (attrgetter): [Person(name='Bob', age=25), Person(name='David', age=25), Person(name='Alice', age=30), Person(name='Charlie', age=35)]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Which one to choose?\n\n*   **`list.sort()`:** Use when you *don't need the original list* and want to save memory (as it modifies the list in-place). It's slightly more performant for lists because it doesn't create a copy.\n*   **`sorted()`:** Use when you *need to preserve the original list* or when sorting any other iterable (tuples, sets, etc.) into a new list. This is generally the safer and more flexible choice for most scenarios.\n\nBoth methods use Timsort, a hybrid stable sorting algorithm, which is highly optimized and efficient for various types of real-world data."

There are two primary methods:\n\n1.  **`list.sort()`**: This method sorts the list **in-place**, meaning it modifies the original list directly and doesn't return a new list (it returns `None`).\n2.  **`sorted()`**: This built-in function returns a **new sorted list**, leaving the original list unchanged. It can take any iterable (not just lists) as input.\n\nLet's look at examples for both, including common customizations.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Using `list.sort()` (In-Place Sort)\n\nUse this when you don't need the original unsorted list anymore.\n\n```python\n# --- Example 1: Basic numeric sort ---\nmy_numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nprint(\"Original numbers:\", my_numbers)\n\nmy_numbers.sort() # Sorts the list in-place, ascending by default\nprint(\"Sorted numbers (ascending):\", my_numbers)\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Example 2: Sorting in descending order ---\nmy_letters = ['z', 'c', 'x', 'a', 'b', 'y']\nprint(\"Original letters:\", my_letters)\n\nmy_letters.sort(reverse=True) # Sorts in-place, descending\nprint(\"Sorted letters (descending):\", my_letters)\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Example 3: Sorting with a custom key (e.g., by string length) ---\nmy_words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"grapefruit\", \"date\"]\nprint(\"Original words:\", my_words)\n\n# Sorts by the length of each word\nmy_words.sort(key=len)\nprint(\"Sorted words (by length):\", my_words)\n\n# Sorts by the length of each word, then reverse\nmy_words.sort(key=len, reverse=True)\nprint(\"Sorted words (by length, descending):\", my_words)\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Example 4: Sorting a list of tuples by a specific element ---\n# A list of (name, age) tuples\npeople = [(\"Alice\", 30), (\"Bob\", 25), (\"Charlie\", 35), (\"David\", 25)]\nprint(\"Original people list:\", people)\n\n# Sort by age (the second element, index 1)\npeople.sort(key=lambda person: person[1])\nprint(\"Sorted people (by age, ascending):\", people)\n\n# Sort by age (descending), then by name (ascending) for ties\n# This shows stability: David and Bob (both 25) maintain their original relative order if not for the second key.\n# For multiple keys, you can create a tuple of keys\npeople.sort(key=lambda person: (person[1], person[0]), reverse=False) # (age, name)\nprint(\"Sorted people (by age then name):\", people)\n\n```\n\n## 2. Using `sorted()` (Returns a New List)\n\nUse this when you want to preserve the original list.\n\n```python\n# --- Example 1: Basic numeric sort ---\nmy_numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nprint(\"Original numbers:\", my_numbers)\n\n# sorted() returns a NEW list, doesn't modify original\nnew_sorted_numbers = sorted(my_numbers)\nprint(\"New sorted numbers (ascending):\", new_sorted_numbers)\nprint(\"Original numbers (unchanged):\", my_numbers)\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Example 2: Sorting in descending order ---\nmy_letters = ['z', 'c', 'x', 'a', 'b', 'y']\nprint(\"Original letters:\", my_letters)\n\nnew_sorted_letters_desc = sorted(my_letters, reverse=True)\nprint(\"New sorted letters (descending):\", new_sorted_letters_desc)\nprint(\"Original letters (unchanged):\", my_letters)\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Example 3: Sorting with a custom key (e.g., by string length) ---\nmy_words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"grapefruit\", \"date\"]\nprint(\"Original words:\", my_words)\n\nnew_sorted_words_by_len = sorted(my_words, key=len)\nprint(\"New sorted words (by length):\", new_sorted_words_by_len)\nprint(\"Original words (unchanged):\", my_words)\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Example 4: Sorting a list of custom objects by an attribute ---\nclass Product:\n    def __init__(self, name, price):\n        self.name = name\n        self.price = price\n    def __repr__(self): # For nice printing\n        return f\"Product({self.name}, ${self.price:.2f})\"\n\nproducts = [\n    Product(\"Laptop\", 1200.00),\n    Product(\"Mouse\", 25.50),\n    Product(\"Keyboard\", 75.00),\n    Product(\"Monitor\", 300.00)\n]\nprint(\"Original products:\", products)\n\n# Sort products by price\nsorted_products_by_price = sorted(products, key=lambda p: p.price)\nprint(\"Sorted products (by price):\", sorted_products_by_price)\n\n# Sort products by name\nsorted_products_by_name = sorted(products, key=lambda p: p.name)\nprint(\"Sorted products (by name):\", sorted_products_by_name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts Explained:\n\n*   **`key` argument**: This is an optional argument that specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element. For example, `key=len` means that for each element, its length will be used for comparison. `key=lambda x: x[1]` means the second element of `x` will be used as the key.\n*   **`reverse` argument**: Set this to `True` to sort in descending order. By default, it's `False` (ascending).\n*   **Stability**: Python's sort is guaranteed to be stable. This means that if two elements have the same key, their relative order in the original list is preserved in the sorted list. This is why when sorting `people` by age (25, 25), \"Bob\" remains before \"David\" if they were originally in that order.\n*   **Performance**: Python's built-in sort uses an algorithm called **Timsort**, which is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It is highly optimized and performs very well on various kinds of real-world data.\n\nChoose `list.sort()` if you don't need the original order, and `sorted()` if you do."
